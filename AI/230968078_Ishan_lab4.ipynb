    "\n",
    "BFS is an uninformed search algorithm that explores a graph level by level, layer by layer. Because it expands all nodes at a given depth before moving deeper, it is guaranteed to find the shortest path length (in terms of number of edges) in an unweighted graph, making its solution optimal. However, this thoroughness comes at a high cost to efficiency, as it often leads to a massive number of nodes expanded. It blindly searches in every direction without a sense of where the goal actually is, often exhausting memory in large search spaces."

    "##### Greedy Best-First Search <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy Best-First Search is an informed search that uses a heuristic function, h(n), to estimate the distance from the current node to the goal. It prioritizes efficiency by always expanding the node that \"appears\" closest to the target, which typically results in far fewer nodes expanded than BFS. However, because it ignores the actual cost incurred to reach the current node, it is not optimal. It can easily be misled by local obstacles, often finding a significantly longer path length than necessary because it \"greedily\" charges toward the goal without looking at the bigger picture."

    "##### A* Search <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A* Search combines the strengths of both BFS and Greedy Search by using a total cost function f(n)=g(n)+h(n), where g(n) is the cost to reach the node and h(n) is the heuristic estimate to the goal. In terms of optimality, A* is the gold standard; as long as the heuristic is admissible (never overestimates), it is guaranteed to find the shortest path length. While it may expand more nodes than a Greedy search, it is far more efficient than BFS because it uses the heuristic to \"prune\" unlikely paths. It balances the need to find the best solution with the need to minimize the number of nodes expanded, making it the most balanced and widely used technique for pathfinding."
